# QuoteGen

Many camera stores deal in second hand photographic equipment. The purpose of this application is to 
make it easy for employees of camera stores to quickly offer quotes to customers for the equipment
they wish to sell or trade.

The application allows the user to quote from 1 to 7 pieces of equipment at once. It uses the eBay api to search for sold listings and calculate a value based on the average sold price of completed listings.  

## Instructions

Step 1: Choose the number of pieces you wish to look up. 

Step 2: Enter once piece of camera equipment per input box. If you dont know any some good examples to try are sony a7s ii, sony a7r ii, nikon d500, canon 5d mark iii, nikon f100, canon 6d mark ii, canon 7d mark ii.

Step 3: The results are displayed as cards with a picture of the item, description and sold price. The user is meant to sift through these results and make sure they represent what they are lookng for. If there is
any item that doesn't quite fit what the user is looking for they can click on that card. It will flip around and the associated price would not be inlcuded in the calculation. To re-add the item simply click the card
again. Once you are satisfied with the results you click calculate to see the prices you should offer. 

Step 4: When viewing the quote results you can look at it in a total view and a per item view. Both views are seperated into buy and trade prices depending on the quality of the item being purchased. Typically camera
stores offer more money for if the customer wants to trade in their equipment against buying something from the store versus simplying selling outright for cash.
